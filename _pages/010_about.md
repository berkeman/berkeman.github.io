Exax, previously the Expertmaker Accelerator, is a well-proven data
processing framework providing fast data access, parallel execution,
reproducibility, and transparency.

Exax can be used for anything from small daily data analysis tasks to
running as multi-CPU backend in live production recommender systems
based on multi-billion row datasets.  It is an excellent tool for data
engineering.

**The Accelerator is released as open source by eBay** under the Apache
V2.0 license, and is under constant development.

The Accelerator was developed by the Swedish AI company Expertmaker.
The first project using the Accelerator was run in 2012, and since
then it has been the core tool in a number of studies and live
production recommender systems. In 2016, Expertmaker was acquired by
eBay.

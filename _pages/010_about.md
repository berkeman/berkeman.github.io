The Expertmaker Accelerator is a well-proven data processing framework
providing fast data access, parallel execution, reproducibility, and
transparency. It can be used for anything from small daily data
analysis tasks to running as multi-CPU backend in live production
recommender systems based on hundreds of thousands of large data
files.

The Accelerator was developed by the Swedish AI company Expertmaker.
The first project using the Accelerator was run in 2012, and since
then it has been the core tool in a number of studies and live
production recommendation systems. In 2016, Expertmaker was acquired
by eBay.

**The Accelerator is released as open source by eBay** under the Apache
V2.0 license, and is updated continuously.

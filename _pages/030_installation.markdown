Install directly from PyPI:

`pip install accelerator`

See this [blog post](https://exax.org/documentation/2019/10/30/initialise.html) for more information.


The Accelerator projects has been built, tested, and runs on:

 - Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, 22.04
 - Debian 10, 11, 12
 - FreeBSD 13

but is not limited to these systems or versions.

The Accelerator works on _both_ Python2 and Python3.  Supported versions
are 2.7 and 3.5-3.11.


## Hardware

The Accelerator runs on a single machine.  Typically, it is run on a
laptop, but anything from a Raspberry Pie to a high performance rack
server works.  More RAM, disk, and CPU cores are better.
